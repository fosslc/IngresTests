	Test Name: pza01sc.sep
	Time: 26-AUG-1991 13:16:28
	User Name: testenv
	Terminal type: septerm
 
	Test ID : pza01sc
	Module  : 3gl
	Filename: pza01sc.sep
	Purpose	: To test simple database operations using cursors
	Input Files  :
	Output Files :
	Database     :	SEPPARAMDB
	Tables       :	dept, employee, toberesolved
	Synopsis     :	This application connects to database personnel, creates
			table toberesolved and declares and opens cursor deptcsr
			to update and delete rows from table employee and insert
			data into table toberesolved.

	History: 26-AUG-1991	Created				Author: saundra

		 01-JUL-1992  	Modified (jpark)
			Modified filenames to conform to DOS specs of
			8 character filenames and 3 character extensions.
			Also, replaced hard-code database names to 
			SEPPARAMDB.
		 29-JUL-1992	Modified (bobs)
			Changed emp.idno from int to long and printf int to
			long so test would work under MS-DOS.
                 18-FEB-1993    Modified (bobs)
                        Added "int" return from main (apxb.sc) and added
                        "exit(0)" at end of main program, for compatibility
                        with Tools for Windows.
		22-FEB-1993	Modified (jpark)
			Moved all of the delete commands to the beginning
			of test from the end of test to conform to testing
			standards.
                20-Aug-1993	Modified (alices) helping jbryson to update
			apxb.sc for 6.5.
			Delete all intermediate files created by the 
			language compiler at the end of the sep test.
                13-Oct-1993	Modified (jbryson) Fixing typo and
			removing ignore canon for compiling and linking.
                01-Apr-1997  Modified (chiel02)
                             Added an alternate canon for the sepcc command.
                             Removed the platform specifications of the canons 
                             for the esqlc command to make it work under NT.
	   	06-Jan-2010  (boija02) II_DATE_CENTURY_BOUNDARY default changing 
			     to 20 caused Carrie Austin to diff, so changed hire
			     date.
