||_Query By Forms (QBF) is an interactive, visually oriented forms interface     ||
||package for adding, deleting, changing and viewing data in your tables.       ||
||                                                                              ||
||The tasks you perform in QBF are divided into two phases: JOIN DEFINITION     ||
||and QUERY EXECUTION.  In the DEFINITION phase you specify the tables you      ||
||wish to query.  Then, in the EXECUTION phase you query those tables and       ||
||browse or update the data.                                                    ||
||                                                                              ||
||You are now in QBF's start-up menu.  From this menu, you can execute various  ||
||commands to get information about the tables in your database or define a join||
||(go to QBF Join Definition phase) and run a query (go to QBF Query Execution  ||
||phase).  To enter a command just type the name of the command followed by a   ||
||carriage return.                                                              ||
||                                                                              ||
||Commands for QBF's start-up menu are:                                         ||

||_Query By Forms (QBF) is an interactive, visually oriented forms interface     ||
||package for adding, deleting, changing and viewing data in your tables.       ||
||                                                                              ||
||Below is a list of functions you can execute from the main menu of QBF's      ||
||Query Execution Phase.  To enter a function just type the name of the         ||
||function followed by a carriage return.  Each function has its own menu       ||
||which you may call by depressing the MENU KEY.  From these menus you can      ||
||receive help by typing the "Help" command or return to the main query         ||
||execution menu by typing the "End" command.                                   ||
||                                                                              ||

||        Retrieve        The function of QBF for browsing rows.                ||
||        Update          The function of QBF for changing and deleting rows.   ||

||descending order, respectively. By default the fields are sorted in ascending ||
||order.  When retrieving data in retrieve or update mode, the field with the   ||
||lowest sequence number will be sorted first, the field with the succeeding    ||

||_With the RETRIEVE function, you can view rows in your JoinDef without changing||
||them. You can invoke the RETRIEVE function either by specifying the           ||
||"-mretrieve" flag in your command line or by typing the "Retrieve" command    ||
||in the QBF Query Execution Phase menu.                                        ||

||You are in the GO state of the QBF RETRIEVE function.  Rows from a previously ||
||entered query are being displayed for you to browse.                          ||

||From the RETRIEVE Function menu you may start a new query by choosing the     ||
||"Query" command or leave the RETRIEVE Function by selecting "End".            ||
||                                                                              ||
